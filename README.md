# Data-Mining-in-Engineering
This study analyzes the predicted accuracy of probability of default among different data mining methods in the instance of default payment of consumers in Taiwan.

Step 1: Analyze the dataset and remove contraditions

Step 2: Perform ANOVA to determine relative features (alpha value 5%). Null hypothesis: H0-Attribute does not affect the target variable, HA- Attribute affects the target variable

Step 3: Develope Pipeline and Ensemble machine learning classes

Step 4: Constructed a classification system for oversampled, undersampled, and actual dataset

Step 5: Analyze the accuracy and percision of the model
